# modelChecker

modelChecker is a tool written for Autodesk Maya to sanity check digital polygon models for production. It aims to be as unopinionated as possible, It gives you concise feedback, and let's you select your error nodes easily.

## Setup

Place the modelChecker files in your maya scripts directory and create a python shell button with the following code:

```python
from modelChecker_UI import modelCheckerUI

modelCheckerUI.show_UI()
```

## Usage

There are three ways to run the checks.

1. If you have objects selected the checks will run on the current selection.
2. A hierachy by declaring a top node in the UI.
3. If you have an empty selection and no top node is declared the checks will run on the entire scene.

The documentation will refer to the nodes you are running checks on as your "declared nodes", to not be confused with your active selection.

Important! Your current selection will have prioirtiy over the top node defined in the UI. The reason is to be able to quickly debug errror nodes.

## Checks

Here is an extensive lists of all of the checks the modelChecker can make on your 3d models. Passing all checks does not inherently make for a good model. Understand what is required for your production will.
